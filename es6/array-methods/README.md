# Array Methods
Ever since IE9 many years ago, Arrays in JavaScript have been extended to have powerful built in methods. These built in methods are now common knowledge (with ideas borrowed from other languages) and its very valuable to know and use these when the opportunity arises.

## Map, Filter & Reduce - The most powerful functions
Check out map-filter-reduce.js, and practice these three functions in coderpad.
Map and Filter are easy to grasp since its as familiar as a forEach loop. 

Reduce, however is just a touch more feature-filled, as you can see in the code. See embedded JS comments. Hint, the args to the callback are (previous, current)

## Find and Sort
Find is similiar to filter, but will return only one item.
