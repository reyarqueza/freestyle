# Use react-webpack-build instead of create-react-app

Here I use my barebones webpack build tool instead of create react app to keep the code to a minimum.

```
git clone https://github.com/reyarqueza/react-webpack-build.git [project_name]
```

Since this is all for the freestyle repo, lets wipe out the .git folders that was cloned:

```
cd [project_name]
rm -rf .git 
```

Now you can add the new [project_name] to the freestyle repo.

Repeat this process for other freestyle folders as you create them.
