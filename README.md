# freestyle

The examples in this repo are intentionally oversimplified for the purpose of excercising freestyle coding.

Freestyle coding is a way to code as easily and naturally as talking. You shouldn't have the need to look up documentation for anything that is freestyled. To reach this level of natural coding, use this repository for reference and practice building small simple things from scratch.

Within this repo are multiple directories split by category:

1. react
2. es6
3. typescript
